# PyLogger

This is a simple Keylogger using Python.
I made this project to learn more about sockets and what can happen if you execute the wrong file.

There are a lot of functionalities that could be added like information on the browser history, taking screenshots, recording audio/camera and many more.

Please do not use this project with bad intentions. It was purely made for learning.

## Features

- Get all key presses in real time using sockets
- Get system information
- Get public/private ip
- Get clipboard content
- Get all passwords used for wifi connections
